As the world has taken strides towards increasing nutritional awareness, calorie-counting has become  increasingly popular as a means for tracking nutritional information. From mitigating the obesity pandemic to ensuring the elderly meet their nutritional needs, it’s clear to see that tracking food can offer crucial health benefits for a variety of people. However, the quality of current calorie-counting apps on the market is far behind the standards of today’s technology. Users search for food items through limited, non-unique databases, often yielding inaccurate and conflicting results which further derail users from their goals. However, an app integrated with the OAK-D device would go far beyond the simplistic approach the industry has taken towards dieting. 
A holistic approach melding together the OAK-D powerhouse with the easy-to-use interface of an app would allow for many benefits. Rather than having users guess from a long list of similar-looking and sounding foods, the app would simply require the user to take a picture of their meal. By utilizing a pretrained machine learning model, a much more richer description of the nutritional make-up of the food item could be realized. Additionally, by harnessing the spatial depth perception of the OAK-D, 3D information about the food could be integrated into the model’s  estimate of the size and weight of the food, thereby greatly increasing accuracy of prediction. 
Large repositories of per-gram nutritional information and food-recognition CNNs are freely open-sourced and available online. To begin with, the app would integrate these services to generate predictions for nutritional information. We anticipate building a pipeline to integrate new information as more and more users join to build more robust models. From our work on VapeMate, we know the best way to positively influence behavior is through creating a clean, enjoyable experience while iteratively adapting insights from technology to committed users. OAK-D provides for a much slicker solution compared to the current market, it would drastically reduce the amount of human effort required, and when integrated with the app will ultimately provide a much clearer path for people to conquer their dietary goals.
